# Portal Sketch

The ChronicleArc portal will be a status board that lists recent artifacts, notes, and inspiration flashes. For now, this markdown file captures the data structure the eventual UI would fetch.

```json
{
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "id": "log-001",
      "title": "Evening CLI stub",
      "status": "draft",
      "summary": "Simple logger appends timestamped notes to a personal journal."
    }
  ],
  "inspiration": [
    "Sketch a habit loop instead of a daily digest.",
    "Treat each log entry like a mini blog post."
  ]
}
```
