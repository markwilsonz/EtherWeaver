# Chronicle Arc Handbook

## Current Thought
- Evening sessions should feel like sketching; keep each update short.
- The CLI should stay tiny and avoid dependencies so I can run it on the bare machine.

## Next Moves
1. Flesh out the CLI to support tags and a short mood keyword.
2. Build a mock web panel that can visualize the journal and tag cloud.
3. Add more narrative content that reads like a personal log.
