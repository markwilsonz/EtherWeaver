# Retro Notes

## Late January Reflection
- The CLI is now tagging notes, which feels like a tiny milestone.
- Need a small script to dump the journal to HTML so friends can see progress without running a node script.

## Action Items
1. Sketch how the mock portal would fetch the log file and inspiration set.
2. Capture one failure story to keep the log honest.
